# CSC 333 - Privacy/Security/Cryptography
This repository contains my assignments, project progress journal and penetration test report as part of the CSC 333 - Privacy/Security/Cryptography course taught by Professors Bastian Tenbergen and James Early.

Please note: I do not have the specifications for the assignment sheets, but do try my best to indicate what I learned from each of them.
